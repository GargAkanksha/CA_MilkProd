    "## The ARIMA Time Series Model\n",
    "Now that we have explored our dataset and done some data-preprocessing, let's move on to time series forecasting with ARIMA.\n",
    "One of the most common methods used in time series forecasting is known as the ARIMA model, which stands for AutoregRessive Integrated Moving Average. ARIMA is a model that can be fitted to time series data in order to better understand or predict future points in the series.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three distinct integers (p, d, q) that are used to parametrize ARIMA models. Together these three parameters account for seasonality, trend, and noise in datasets:\n",
    " * p is the auto-regressive part of the model. It allows us to incorporate the effect of past values into our model. Intuitively, this would be similar to stating that it is likely to be warm tomorrow if it has been warm the past 3 days.\n",
    " * d is the integrated part of the model. This includes terms in the model that incorporate the amount of differencing (i.e. the number of past time points to subtract from the current value) to apply to the time series. Intuitively, this would be similar to stating that it is likely to be same temperature tomorrow if the difference in temperature in the last three days has been very small.\n",
    " * q is the moving average part of the model. This allows us to set the error of our model as a linear combination of the error values observed at previous time points in the past.\n",
    " \n",
    "When dealing with seasonal effects, we make use of the seasonal ARIMA, which is denoted as ARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)s. Here, (p, d, q) are the non-seasonal parameters described above, while (P, D, Q) follow the same definition but are applied to the seasonal component of the time series. The term s is the periodicity of the time series (4 for quarterly periods, 12 for yearly periods, etc.)."

    "To iteratively explore different combinations of parameters and select the optimal parameter values for our ARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)s time series model, we will perform a grid search. Once we have explored the entire landscape of parameters, our optimal set of parameters will be the one that yields the best performance for our criteria of interest - AIC."

A model that fits the data very well while using lots of features will be assigned a larger AIC score than a model that uses fewer features to achieve the same goodness-of-fit. Therefore, we are interested in finding the model that yields the lowest AIC value."
